<h2> Hi, there! I'm Rita. Nice to finally meet you. </h2>
<p> I'm originally from Cleveland, Ohio and have recently moved to the Detroit area.
  Althogh I'm fiercely proud of where I've come from, I'm happy to be in a vibrant city with a rich history and interesting people. There's always so much to do here!
</p>
<p> I graduated from The Ohio State University in 2014 with a B.A. in English and a Minor in Professional Writing. During the course of my college years, I held internships at places like Columbus Museum of Art, a startup called Xcelerate Media, and Department of Human Resources and Planning at the University. When I graduated, I worked for the Sherwin-Williams corporate office as a Marketing Co-Op and also as a E-Commerce Financial Processor.
  My most recent experience is working as a Sales Consultant at Progressive Insurance, where I met and exceeded my sales goals each week, having one of the highest close rates on my team despite being the newest memeber.
</p>
<p> Although I loved the challenge of sales, I am looking to transition to use my skills helping others in a different capacity: front-end development. I'd like to help make interfaces more user-friendly so that people can access the information that they need in a way that feels intuitive. My goal is to create code that looks and feels effortless to the end user.
